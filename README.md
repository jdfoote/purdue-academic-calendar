This is a very simple python script that uses BeautifulSoup to grab events from Purdue's academic calendar, and exports a CSV that you can import into Google Calendar, etc.

If you just want the calendar, it's [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=f96f98bc8d673381afab18f3be0f09fc8eb8548338a2c28e9ce741b87d5e9bbc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FIndiana%2FIndianapolis). I believe that clicking "Add to Google Calendar" will subscribe you.
